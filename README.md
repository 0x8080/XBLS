please enjoy the entire method.
I hope this helps people

credits and thank you

Teir (Levi#0131): for 90% of the research that is posted in the resource directory and the hypervisor execution

Golden: for some of the information regarding the RSA data specifically in the encryption algorithms

TOM: for the release of the teapot API on demon forms, and a good starting point for RSA data. (you get a bad rep but you're a good guy)


some of the code is mine and a lot of the code is other people's the web API and the PHP script made by me. as well as in the research c  dumps of the hypervisor we're also done by me and the labeling was done by me as well. there is a lot of information in here that was done by me. there's also other information in here that was done by other people and cooperated on me.


regardless this leak was necessary, a lot of people in the community have suffered for the stealth community. as well as the Xbox community in a hole God bless and rest Nate. as well as other people who have suffered due to the Xbox community and the anger that has been passed through it. we have lost a lot of good people to Suicide. because of hatred from the toxic community. it's sad to see where this has gone.


!!in the end we all find out that money is the root of all evil and it maintains its value!!

p.s. https://github.com/XBLHammer/API-Server-Example there is a client example here for using the API uploaded. however we are still offering free API access for those who have a hard time setting it up. just join our Discord and the website will be available unfortunately we're not allowed to post that kind of website here I've already gotten warnings :)



again as I said in the email to Microsoft at Microsoft. if you randomize the salts, if you look at the Xebuild patches themselves and change functions. enough to break patterns. all of the important people in the community who could update this stuff is gone. so if you make actual changes and randomize salts these people are done. you can take your system back. the community has literally ran out all the intelligent people by attacking them insulting them and toxicity so if you make any actual changes at this point it's over for all of them, I mean you don't even really have to randomize this salts just change all of them.
